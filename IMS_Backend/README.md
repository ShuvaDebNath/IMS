## Backend Boilerplate for ASP.NET CORE DEVELOPER

## Description

This boilerplate is designed to simplify and accelerate the daily workflow of backend developers by addressing repetitive and time-consuming tasks.

With over five years of professional experience, I have observed that developers frequently encounter routine CRUD operationsâ€”tasks that involve no complex logic, algorithms, or intricate implementations. These operations typically consist of receiving data from the frontend, binding it to a model, and then saving, retrieving, updating, or deleting the data in a database.

To alleviate this redundancy, I created a dynamic solution that allows developers to focus on more meaningful and impactful work. This boilerplate empowers developers to:

- Perform dynamic CRUD operations efficiently with minimal effort.
- Handle two-layer operations in a single request, enabling seamless insert, update, or delete operations across two related tables simultaneously.
- Retrieve data from two or more tables dynamically, streamlining multi-table querying.
- This solution is a step toward saving developers' time, enhancing productivity, and enabling them to contribute more effectively to the developer community and beyond.

By incorporating this boilerplate into your workflow, you can achieve greater efficiency and focus on building innovative solutions that truly make a difference.
